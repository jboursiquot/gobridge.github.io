                <h2>How workshops happen</h2>
                
                <p>Planning GoBridge workshops should be visible and transparent. Visibility makes it easier 
                for us to help each other and show new organizers how we work. To jump in, check out the 
                list of workshops currently being planned.</p>
                
                <p>When organizing, remember the mission of GoBridge is to diversify and improve the software 
                development community. We ask that:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="badge">1</span>
                        <p>Your workshop reach out to a group of people that are under-represented in the 
                        community. That might be women, people of color, non-native English speakers, LGBQA 
                        communities, or any other under-represented groups.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="badge">2</span>
                        <p>Your workshop is free for students to attend. We want to remove as many barriers 
                        to entry as possible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="badge">3</span>
                        <p>If you do not belong to an under-represented group and would like to help setup an 
                        event, it is best to find someone who represents the group to be the lead. Help 
                        them own and run the event and be there to provide support.</p>

                <p>Most GoBridge workshops take place in offices of companies that support what we're doing. 
                To offer your space, filter the workshops to those that <a href="#">need a venue!</a> If you 
                find a workshop you want to host, chime in with a note on the issue, and let the organizers 
                know the location and capacity of your office, along with anything else you think will be 
                relevant for the organizers.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I work at Sprokets Incoporated, and we'd love to host this workshop!</p>
                    
                    <p>We're located at 123 4th Street. We have an open area for lunch; that space holds 
                    about 50 people. And we have 8 mid-size conference rooms that together can hold
                    about 45 people. So 45 is probably the max for our space. Each conference room has
                    monitors and whiteboards.</p>
                    
                    <p>We'll be able to sponsor the event up to <b>$1,000</b>. And a person from the company can
                    commit to being there through the entire workshop.</p>
                    
                    <p>I talked with our facilities manager, and everyone on the RSVP list can skip signing 
                    with security when they come in. Let me know if it's a deal; I'm super excited to
